        <h2>What we've done</h2>
        <p> So throughout this intersession we have worked on a variety of projects.
            Some of these included apocalyptical scenarios, what influenced us, and the recent epidemic the Covid-19 Virus.
            Throughout this class we have learned many different techniques in order to acheive these tasks. 
            The projects made challenged us to look at our world in a deeper meaning and how some of these events affect others differently.
            Being a relatively new coder, I hope you enjoy the products below :).
